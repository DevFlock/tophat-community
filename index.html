        <p>The Tophat Community, often referred to as “Tophat Gang” or “🎩 Community” is a group of horny teens, most of whom share interest in technology, space, programming, gaming, politics, dick-measuring* and harassing moderators, not exclusive to the server in question. The server emerged like a Phoenix from the ash of ruined relations. It was fueled by anger, disappointment and enthusiasm to create something better.<br><br>

            The majority of members are inactive, and the active members account for an overwhelming percentage of messages sent. The phenomenon is known as the Pareto principle. In the first few months of the server, there were five moderators, although the number had varied as one moderator effectively stepped down and another one was recruited. Even though no official meetup or physical event has occurred, some members have met and know the real identity behind their aliases online. At the time of writing, the server has 88 members and is over one year old. It has been active since the server’s creation.<br><br>
            
            The sever has various channels ranging from general chatting to games to tech to politics. It also has restricted NSFW-channels. Some events have been hosted by the moderators and members of the server, some with great and some with limits success. The latest event is a Minecraft War Server, where members of the Tophat Gang will fight against another, slightly larger server owned by a moderator that left their position a few months after the server’s creation. One previous, similar event was hosted some months back which was mostly positively received, hence the second one.<br><br>
            
            Although this is only a brief overview of the community and the members in it, I hope to give a fair representation of the server. I myself have loved my time here and hope to spend much more with you all.<br><br><br>
